# Area-Calculator-Android

This is a Android Application that calculates the Area of the Selected Shape, based on the selected shape 
the user will be asked to enter the lengths of sides of the selected shape. 

After entering the sides when the user clicks on calculate area button, the area will be calculated and displayed 
in the application.

I have implemented all the validations and Toast Messages in this Application.
